/**
 * Thin wrapper around Cloudflare's native Rate Limiting binding
 * (env.<name>.limit()) -- not Durable Objects, which the original roadmap
 * assumed. Cloudflare now ships this as a first-class binding (Wrangler
 * >=4.36.0, confirmed current as of this block): near-zero added latency
 * (counters are cached locally per Cloudflare location) and no custom
 * class/storage code to maintain, so it replaced the original approach.
 *
 * Keys by IP (cf-connecting-ip), not the binding's own best-practice
 * recommendation of a stable user/tenant ID -- justified here because the
 * strict AUTH_RATE_LIMITER guards pre-authentication endpoints (no userId
 * exists yet), and the looser API_RATE_LIMITER is meant as a coarse abuse
 * floor across the whole API, not a precise per-tenant quota. Keying
 * authenticated routes by userId instead is a reasonable future refinement.
 *
 * PUBLIC_RATE_LIMITER (QR Engagement Block 2) guards the anonymous QR/
 * feedback surface the same way AUTH_RATE_LIMITER guards pre-auth
 * endpoints -- IP is the only signal available pre-token-resolution.
